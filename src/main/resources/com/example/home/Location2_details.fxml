In the west, the park is bordered by River Kumubukkan Oya; to the south is south-eastern coast that runs to Panama. A 200 hectares mangrove swamp called “Kumana Villu” within the Park is subject to occasional inundation with sea water. It is at this swamp that many water birds nest, during the months of May and June. Scattered in the Kumana National Park are several water pools that are favorite spots of the wildlife: Kudawila wewa, Thummulla wewa and Kotalinda wewa." textAlignment="JUSTIFY" wrappingWidth="900.0">

Regular sightings include species such as Pelicans, Painted Storks, Spoonbills, White Ibis and Cormorants. The very rare Black-necked Stork has also been spotted in the swamp. Besides the prolific birdlife, Kumana is also home to some of the mammals found in the neighbouring Yala National Park such as elephants and leopards which can also be seen on safari. Other animals which reside inside the Kumana National Park include the Golden Jackal and the European Otter. It is also reported that approximately 30 to 40 Sri Lankan Elephants reside in the Park, although they do crossover to Yala." wrappingWidth="450.0">
